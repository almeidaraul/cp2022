# Competitive Programming stuff - 2022 version
Studying for the ICPC in 2022, after some good 10 months of no CP

# Repository
The LaTeX-related stuff (header, code) was heavily based/slightly copied off of 
[Bruno Maletta's Biblioteca](https://github.com/brunomaletta/Biblioteca)

- Dependencies: `texlive-{latex-base, latex-recommended, formats-extra, luatex}`
- Under `notebook`, run `getlatex.sh` to generate PDF files (notebook, theoretical summary, etc)
- Compiling:
	- `c`: g++17
	- `c14`: g++14
	- `p3`: pypy3
- `tp FILE`: generate `FILE.cpp` in working directory from `code/extra/template.cpp`
- `clip FILE`: copy `A.cpp` (macro for `cat A.cpp | clip.exe` - WSL-intended)
