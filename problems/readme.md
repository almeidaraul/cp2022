# Life Editorial
All problems that I solve after october 8, 2022.

Leave two spaces before and after each problem to make this more readable.


## [Weird Algorithm](cses/weird_algorithm.cpp) - [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068/) (09/10/22)
_ad hoc_

This is an implementation of the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).
n gets pretty big so you need a `long long`


## [Problem name](readme.md) - [link to problem - judge name](readme.md) (dd/mm/yy)
_topics, separated, by, commas_

Solution + Takeaways/Comments/Analysis/Resources

Preferably with hints first, e.g.,
- **Hint 1:** (hint)
- **Hint 2:** (hint)
(and then the full solution)
